Definition of Software
Software is a collection of programs, data, and instructions that tell a computer how to perform specific tasks. Unlike hardware, which refers to the physical components of a computer, software is intangible and consists of code that runs on the hardware to accomplish various functions.

System Software
System software is a type of software designed to manage and control the computer hardware and provide a platform for running application software. It acts as an intermediary between the user and the computer hardware, ensuring smooth and efficient operation.

Functions of System Software
System software performs several critical functions, including:

Operating System Management

Provides a user interface (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).
Manages system resources like CPU, memory, and storage.
Controls input/output operations.
File Management

Organizes and stores data efficiently.
Provides access control and security for files.
Device Management

Facilitates communication between hardware and software.
Uses drivers to ensure hardware components function correctly.
Process and Task Management

Manages running applications and system processes.
Allocates resources and schedules tasks efficiently.
Security and System Protection

Implements user authentication and access control.
Protects against viruses and malware.
Networking and Communication

Manages network connections and internet access.
Enables data sharing between devices.
Utility Programs

Includes tools for system maintenance, such as disk cleanup and backup utilities.
Examples of System Software
Operating Systems: Windows, Linux, macOS
Utility Software: Antivirus programs, disk defragmenters
Firmware: Embedded software in devices like routers and smart appliances
System software is essential for the operation of any computing device, as it ensures that both the hardware and application software function properly.
